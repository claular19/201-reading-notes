Git is a system designed to keep track of edits as people collaborate on projects together. Github hosts repositories and provides developers with tools to build off of previous 
code.
Visual Studio Code is a program that allows developers to edit their code in a more user-friendly and personally designed way. Helping with syntax makes code easier to understand
and providing community-created keyboard shortcuts for ease of navigation inside your code.
Takeaway: Both of these programs will be incredibly useful for the work we do because they create a user-friendly experience. They do this by adding quality of life changes on top
of the current systems, making the coding experience more enjoyable.
