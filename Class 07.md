Powershell allows admins to manage Windows computers from the oommand line. Powershell pushes the output of a command as an input for another (pipeline). Compared to Bash, 
Powershell allows the user to push around large and complex data. It also allows for accurate automation of many tasks.
Very common now for hackers to use powershell to push their attacks. They directly inject their attack into the memory of the system. They're allowed to get away with this when 
certain systems stay exposed unintentionally. The strength of Powershell then becomes it's weakness as hackers breeze through non-existent restrictions.

Takeaway: As we learn about Powershell's capabilities, it's important to understand how it can create a open pathway for hackers to access sensitive information and the 
preventitive measures we can use to reduce risk.
