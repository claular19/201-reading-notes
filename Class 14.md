If you think you've obtained malware on your PC the first thing you should do is go into Safe Mode. If the PC already starts running faster, then there's probably active malware
that was slowing it down. After that, try to remove temporary files so that running Disk Cleanup can be faster. Malware scanners like Malwarebytes, BitDefender, and
SuperAntiSpyware can do a further scan to identify malware. Keeping antivirus consistently running and scanning for threats will keep a PC safe or at least make you aware if a 
new threat does arise.

Takeaway: As technology gets more advanced, so do cybersecurity threats. It's important to know how you can identify and locate malware, but even better, *prevent* it from infecting
your machine. I can use my knowledge of firewall configuration to set up a safe environment for my machines.
