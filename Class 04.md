Most important step of troubleshooting is gathering as much information as possible so you can diagnose the issue (usually multiple problems). Next you'll have to theory-craft a 
solution to the issues at hand (should start with easiest/simplest theories so you may resolve the issue swiftly). At the end, preventitive measures should be set up for the 
future and the whole situation and resolution should be documented.

Takeaway: Learning how to troubleshoot efficiently will not only help with our IT skills, but also help us troubleshoot our *own* problems as we run into them in labs and
challenges.
