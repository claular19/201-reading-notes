SMB allows for computers to communicate with each other. A client will make a request and then the server will respond to that request. Requires an open port (usually port 139 and
445). Can be dangerous to have these ports open to the internet. The service using that port would have to be "misconfigured, unpatched, vulnerable to exploits, or have poor 
network security rules."

Takeaway: Understanding how this service works with ports and how it can be potentially exploited is very relevant for our cyber security journey as we learn more about how to 
prevent malicious attacks while still being able to use useful services like SMB.

SMB= Server Message Block Protocol
