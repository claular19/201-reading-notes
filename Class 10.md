Veeam free edition has a few important features worth exploring. VeamZIP allows you to creat backups of running VMs, useful for archiving, updating, or copying a VM some place 
else. Veeam also allows multiple ways to recover data by restoring VM files, restoring the whole VM, or restroing VM disks. The last important feature is its ability to allow
for quick migration between different hosts for transferring VMs.

Takeaway: Veeam seems like a convenient tool for easily backing up and restoring data. When learning about backing up and recovering data, it's important to understand the 
resources we have to do so.
