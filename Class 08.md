Windows Registry includes and manages all your system related settings. Each time you log on, Windows loads these settings into its memory. Can edit these settings in Registry 
Editor. This is useful for editing settings that might be hidden/hard to find on the normal interface. The systems configuration can be messed up if these settings get edited
improperly, so it's useful to follow 'registry hacks' to edit things.

Takeaway: Being able to navigate the Windows Registry adds another layer of troubleshooting that we can pursue if we believe a problem is originating from an edit of the registry.
