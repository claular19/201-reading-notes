Virtualization became popularized when VMWare gave the ability for anyone to virtualize a standard computer using its own resources to virtualize multiple OS's. Amazon's EC2 
provides virtual servers from a Xen hypervisor. The hypervisor resides on top of the host machine and manages the virtual machines. AMI (Amazon Machine Image) creates immediate 
virtual machines within Amazon's EC2.

Takeaway: AWS services are important to understand as we continue to learn further about virtual machines and how they work. AWS uses a system that allows them to efficiently 
manage their virtual machines through appliances like EC2 and AMI.
IaaS = Infrastructure as a Service. Such as AWS.
