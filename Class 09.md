SOP = Standard Operating Procedure
SOPs allow a company or organization to create a document that enforce their beliefs on how their procedures will be run. They create a way to reinforce these ideas so that people
fully understand the goal of their organization. They have to be regularly updated as goals and beliefs change. There's no specific *right* way to create an SOP but it should be
understandable for everyone and push for goals to be achieved. SOPs should be concise and consistent so that the audience can understand in a simple way.
