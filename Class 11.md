SSDs failing are hard to detect. A bad block means your SSD is vulnerable to faulty memory. Can solve failing SSD through formatting and redownloading the OS, power cycling by removing the SATA cable and leaving the power cable in, updating drivers, or updating the SSD's firmware. Recovering data can be accomplished depending on the complications that are occuring. Always have backups in case of drive failures.
DBAN can be used to wipe a hard drive. You have to boot into the program through a disk or usb drive. The program has an interface for simply erasing your hard drive accessed by pressing f3 on launch. From there you can select the drive you want to wipe.

Takeaway: Considering hard drives can still posess data even after formatting, it's important to know what options there are to fully wipe the drive so that sensitive data can't be accessed when the hard drive is disposed of. The UK National Health Service Survey improperly wiping their donated hard drives and leaking patient information is evidence of the importance.
