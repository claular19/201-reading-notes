The Windows System Restore tool allows you to revert to a specific restore point that includes old software, registry, and drivers. It's easy to achieve and important in the early
stages of troubleshooting. This tool can be found in the System protection section. You have to select a specific restore point you want to revert to. Important to note that this 
tool does NOT affect any non-system related files that are personal, such as pictures and documents. Windows will regularly create restore points on its own before events like 
system updates.
Execute command: rstrui.exe
Registry: database that stores low-level settings for Windows OS and any applications that opt to use it.
